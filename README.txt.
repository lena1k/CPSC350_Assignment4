I worked alone on this project. 

Sources used:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/
Data Structures & Algorithms in C++ (used textbook for Queue and Doubly Linked List implementation)



Source files:
DoublyLinkedList.h
GenQueue.h
NodeList.h
registrar.h
Statistics.h
student.h
main.cpp
registrar.cpp
statistics.cpppp
student.cpp

To run:
1) navigate folder
2) g++ *.cpp
3) ./a.out test.txt

The way I calculated the mean student wait time is from the time to student entered the registrar office and left. 
Inclusive of the time they needed of the window.
